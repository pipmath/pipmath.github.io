abstract = {We consider enstrophy dissipation in two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes flows and focus on how this quantity behaves in the limit of vanishing viscosity. After recalling a number of a priori estimates providing lower and upper bounds on this quantity, we state an optimization problem aimed at probing the sharpness of these estimates as functions of viscosity. More precisely, solutions of this problem are the initial conditions with fixed palinstrophy and possessing the property that the resulting 2D Navier-Stokes flows locally maximize the enstrophy dissipation over a given time window. This problem is solved numerically with an adjoint-based gradient ascent method and solutions obtained for a broad range of viscosities and lengths of the time window reveal the presence of multiple branches of local maximizers, each associated with a distinct mechanism for the amplification of palinstrophy. The dependence of the maximum enstrophy dissipation on viscosity is shown to be in quantitative agreement with the estimate due to Ciampa et al. (2021), demonstrating the sharpness of this bound.}
